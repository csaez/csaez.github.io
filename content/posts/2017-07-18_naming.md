Hi folks,

In a new attempt to do a live coding series, I've been recording these sessions implementing a very
simple naming convention manager/thingy in python. Just like
[dgpy](https://www.cesarsaez.me/2015/12/dgpy.html), the idea is to keep it short and straight
forward (hopefully each series gets better, although I like to keep them kinda raw so we can share
how things evolved and not an artificial session where everything works first try).

What are we trying to solve here?

This comes back from when I was developing
[riglab](https://www.cesarsaez.me/2014/02/riglab-preview-002.html) a few years ago, one of the
things I wanted to do there was to make it "pipeline friendly", so people can integrate it
seamlessly without introducing any unnecessary friction into the pipeline. This meant that any
tool using metadata stored on names cannot assume anything about it and a configuration layer is
needed. This also applies to any sort of distributable tools.

Anyway, there are 11 videos at the time of this writing and the project provides enough
functionality to be useful in a real scenario.

One thing I particularly like about this series is how we moved from some not-so-great code (in
order to keep things moving) to a more desirable end result with total confidence thanks to the
development process, it wasn't planned that way but it kinda happened.

The source code is on [github](https://github.com/csaez/naming) (MIT license), but the value
of the project is more on the educational side of things (imho).

Let me know what you think :smiley:

Cheers!
