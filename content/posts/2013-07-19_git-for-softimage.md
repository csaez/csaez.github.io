Hi folks,

I've been using [Git][1] as version control system on my
developments for a while and thought it might be useful add some version
control abilities to my softimage projects too.

<https://github.com/csaez/gitforsoftimage>

It implements:

- Commit history
- Branching
- Remotes

If you don't want to continue the 'incremental save' madness, or if you
are looking for an easy way to collaborate with others in small
projects, give it a try, it's free and open!

Let me know what you think,

Cheers.

By the way, if you're not familiar with distributed version control
systems there are a few key concepts that must be considered, don't
forget to check the [documentation][2].
