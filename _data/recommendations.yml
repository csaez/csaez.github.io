    Cesar is a skilled software engineer who believes in the craft of coding and has a great understanding of how
    software fits together. He doesn't settle for what's worked in the past, but is an innovator who searches for newer,
    better and cooler ways to do things.

    I had the pleasure of working with Cesar for The Lego Batman movie and Lego Ninjago Movie. He was a great problem
    solver and was always looking for ways to improve our processes and pipeline. I depended on him to assist our more
    entry level team members and he did a great job teaching us new ways to produce better code.

    The best assets of Cesar are their creativity in front of problems and his increidble human touch. 
    During his time as Lead Character TD, he worked to provide flexibility and reliability to the rigs, as well as tools for all the departments. 
    Then, he took the helm of the rigging department and thanks to him we were able to work as a solid team, bringing solutions for all the studio, and facing long-term goals for next productions. And after all this, it seems that we only scratch the surface of his ideas and potential.

    Cesar has an excellent balance of innovation and productivity. He is always thinking about faster, cleaner and
    reusable ways to achieve things but never forgets that his tools and rigs will be used by people in a real
    production. Furthermore, he likes teamwork and is willing to help colleagues. I am lucky to be working with him.
