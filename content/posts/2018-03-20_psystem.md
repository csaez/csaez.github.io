Hi folks,

Some time ago I recorded this little video developing a simple particle system,
from scratch, as an exercise and I thought it would be cool to also share it in here.

The goal?

To share my approach when facing problems like this, demystifying the difficulty of getting
a standalone prototype like this up and running. This was also a nice exercise to move out
of the sandbox provided by certain platforms, taking out the training wheels.

As usual, code is licensed under MIT at [github](https://github.com/csaez/psystem).


Let me know what you think.

Cheers!
