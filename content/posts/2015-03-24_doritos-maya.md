Hi folks,

Last night I captured this short video on how to recreate the [famous
'dorito' setup](http://www.softimageblog.com/archives/209) in Autodesk Maya.

In case you are not familiar with the term (it's mainly a Softimage lingo), it
simply refers to a way of splitting the skinning deformation into different
layers, where each layer rides on top of the previous one avoiding double
transformations.

The technique itself is nothing new and there are
[several](https://vimeo.com/91005555) [videos](https://vimeo.com/87722342)
[explaining](https://vimeo.com/88615637) how to do it in different softwares,
but looks like the Maya approach is a bit convoluted and I wanted to share a
straight forward way to do it without any rants on how good or bad Maya
workflow is.

Hope you like it,

Cheers!
