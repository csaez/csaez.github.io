During his time as Lead Character TD, he worked to provide flexibility and reliability to the rigs, as well as tools for all the departments. 
Then, he took the helm of the rigging department and thanks to him we were able to work as a solid team, bringing solutions for all the studio, and facing long-term goals for next productions. And after all this, it seems that we only scratch the surface of his ideas and potential.
