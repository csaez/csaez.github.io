Hi folks,

I would like to introduce a little python library I've been working on my spare
time to help TDs and TAs to draw OpenGL primitives in Maya viewport for
debugging purposes and/or non-critical tools (adding graphics as hints on tools
and what not).

Instead of me writing a wall of text I recorded a short video showing the main
features in action.

The [source code of `mscreen`](https://github.com/csaez/mscreen) is available
on GitHub, and released under the MIT license. There's also some technical docs
at [https://www.cesarsaez.me/mscreen](http://www.cesarsaez.me/mscreen).


I hope you like it, enjoy :smiley:
