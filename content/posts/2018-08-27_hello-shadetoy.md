I've been always amazed by the incredible work people share at [shadertoy](http://www.shadertoy.com),
it's truly a privilege to be able to explore the gallery while taking a look at the source code right
there in the browser, play around changing parameters and learning different approaches.

So, after years looking from the distance I decided to give it a try... and guess what? It's a
lot of fun!

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
<iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" src="https://www.shadertoy.com/embed/Md3cW7?gui=true&t=10&paused=false&muted=false" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

> You can even interact with it by dragging the cursor over the canvas!


My humble [doodles](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/csaez) are far from those impressive
[shaders of the week](https://www.shadertoy.com/playlist/week), but the community has proved to be
an amazing one by giving very constructive feedback and I've certainly learned a lot while bending
my mind trying to figure out how to express a certain algorithm in a parallel friendly way.

</div>


Anyway, I just wanted to recommend [shadertoy](http://www.shadertoy.com) to everyone: the barrier of entry
has never been lower (you just need a browser), the community is truly amazing and the gallery is
full of great shaders to learn from.

Don't be shy and give it a try, you can thank me later :wink:

Cheers!
