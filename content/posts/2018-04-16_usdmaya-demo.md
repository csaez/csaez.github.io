I made this demo showcasing some of the work we are doing at Animal Logic regarding our
integration of USD within Autodesk Maya (aka `AL_USDMaya` plugin, more
[here](https://github.com/AnimalLogic/AL_USDMaya)).

It was a fantastic experience to be involved on the many iterations integrating USD in the studio,
developing an integration of the likes of `AL_USDMaya` was a huge undertaking made only
possible by the many talented developers contributing within the studio and in the open source
community.

> It's inspiring to see all the progress made since then :)

Cheers!
